I am a final year astronomy and astrophysics PhD student at the Australian National University. My research topic is Galactic archaeology: measuring the chemical composition of stars in the Milky Way to understand it's formation and evolution. My work focuses on 3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium modelling of stellar spectra and applying machine learning techniques to large spectroscopic datasets.
