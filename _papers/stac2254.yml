abstract: "{M 22 (NGC 6656) is a chemically complex globular cluster-like system reported\
  \ to harbour heavy element abundance variations. However, the extent of these variations\
  \ and the origin of this cluster is still debated. In this work, we investigate\
  \ the chemical in-homogeneity of M 22 using differential line-by-line analysis of\
  \ high-quality (R = 110\u2009000, S/N  = 300 per pixel at 514 nm) VLT/UVES spectra\
  \ of six carefully chosen red giant branch stars. By achieving abundance uncertainties\
  \ as low as \u223C0.01 dex (\u223C2 per\u2009cent), this high precision data validates\
  \ the results of previous studies and reveals variations in Fe, Na, Si, Ca, Sc,\
  \ Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Y, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu. Additionally, we can confirm\
  \ that the cluster hosts two stellar populations with a spread of at least 0.24\
  \ dex in [Fe/H] and an average s-process abundance spread of 0.65 dex. In addition\
  \ to global variations across the cluster, we also find non-negligible variations\
  \ within each of the two populations, with the more metal-poor population hosting\
  \ larger spreads in elements heavier than Fe than the metal-rich. We address previous\
  \ works that do not identify anomalous abundances and relate our findings to our\
  \ current dynamical understanding of the cluster. Given our results, we suggest\
  \ that M 22 is either a nuclear star cluster, the product of two merged clusters,\
  \ or an original building block of the Milky Way.}"
