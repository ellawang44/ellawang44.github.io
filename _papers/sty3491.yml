abstract: '{Most cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution include active galactic
  nucleus (AGN) feedback, typically seeding black holes with masses of \\$\\ge 10^5\\,
  h^\\{-1\\}\\, \\rm \\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$ when the dark matter halo exceeds a
  given threshold mass. Taylor \\&amp; Kobayashi introduced a new model, which seeds
  black holes at \\$10^3\\, h^\\{-1\\}\\, \\rm \\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$ based on
  gas properties alone, and motivated by the channel of black hole formation due to
  the collapse of the most massive first stars in the Universe.

  We compare the black hole mass when the dark matter halo mass is \\$10^\\{10\\}\\,
  h^\\{-1\\}\\, \\rm \\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$ between the different seeding methods.
  We find that seeding based upon gas properties gives a distribution of black hole
  masses with \\$\\langle \\log M\_\\{\\rm \\{BH\\}\\}\\{/ \\rm \\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot
  \\}\\} \\rangle = (5.18 \\pm 0.54)\\$ when dark matter halo mass is \\$10^\\{10\\}\\,
  h^\\{-1\\}\\, \\rm \\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$, consistent with the seeding criteria
  used in other simulations. However, the evolution of individual galaxies can be
  strongly affected by the different seeding mechanisms. We also find that the mean
  value of the distribution of black hole masses at a given halo mass evolves over
  time, with higher masses at higher redshifts, indicative of downsizing. Our results
  can inform more physically motivated black hole and AGN feedback models in cosmological
  simulations and semi-analytic models.}'
