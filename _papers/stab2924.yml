abstract: "{The detection of 6Li in Spite plateau stars contradicts the standard big\
  \ bang nucleosynthesis prediction, known as the second cosmological lithium problem.\
  \ We measure the isotopic ratio 6Li/7Li in three Spite plateau stars: HD 84937,\
  \ HD 140283, and LP 815\u221243. We use 3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative\
  \ transfer and for the first time apply this to high-resolution, high signal-to-noise\
  \ ratio data from the ultra-stable ESPRESSO/Very Large Telescope spectrograph. These\
  \ are among the best spectra ever taken of any metal-poor stars. As the measurement\
  \ of 6Li/7Li is degenerate with other physical stellar parameters, we employ Markov\
  \ chain Monte Carlo methods to find the probability distributions of measured parameters.\
  \ As a test of systematics, we also use three different fitting methods. We do not\
  \ detect 6Li in any of the three stars, and find consistent results between our\
  \ different methods. We estimate 2\u03C3 upper limits to 6Li/7Li of 0.7, 0.6, and\
  \ 1.7 per cent, respectively, for HD 84937, HD 140283, and LP 815\u221243. Our results\
  \ indicate that there is no second cosmological lithium problem, as there is no\
  \ evidence of 6Li in Spite plateau stars.}"
