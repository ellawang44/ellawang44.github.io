abstract: "{Accurately known stellar lithium abundances may be used to shed light\
  \ on a variety of astrophysical phenomena such as big bang nucleosynthesis, radial\
  \ migration, ages of stars and stellar clusters, and planet engulfment events. We\
  \ present a grid of synthetic lithium spectra that are computed in non-local thermodynamic\
  \ equilibrium (NLTE) across the stagger grid of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic\
  \ stellar atmosphere models. This grid covers three Li lines at 610.4, 670.8, and\
  \ 812.6\u2009nm for stellar parameters representative of FGK-type dwarfs and giants,\
  \ spanning Teff = 4000--7000\u2009K, log\u2009g = 1.5--5.0, \\\\$[\\\\rm \\\\{Fe\\\
  \\}/\\\\rm \\\\{H\\\\}]= -4.0\\\\$--0.5, and A(Li) = \u22120.5--4.0. We find that\
  \ our abundance corrections are up to 0.15\u2009dex more negative than in previous\
  \ work, due to a previously overlooked NLTE effect of blocking of UV lithium lines\
  \ by background opacities, which has important implications for a wide range of\
  \ science cases. We derive a new 3D NLTE solar abundance of A(Li) = 0.96 $\\pm$\
  \ 0.05, which is 0.09\u2009dex lower than the commonly used value. We make our grids\
  \ of synthetic spectra and abundance corrections publicly available through the\
  \ breidablik package. This package includes methods for accurately interpolating\
  \ our grid to arbitrary stellar parameters through methods based on Kriging (Gaussian\
  \ process regression) for line profiles, and multilayer perceptrons (a class of\
  \ fully connected feedforward neural networks) for NLTE corrections and 3D NLTE\
  \ abundances from equivalent widths, achieving interpolation errors of the order\
  \ of 0.01\u2009dex.}"
